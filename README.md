# Clustering Techniques on the Iris Dataset
## Overview
### This repository contains an implementation of clustering techniques—KMeans and Hierarchical clustering—on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements of iris flowers and their respective species. The aim of this project is to explore how these clustering algorithms can identify patterns and groupings in the data without prior labels.

# Objective
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate the application of clustering techniques to a real-world dataset and to gain insights into data structures.
