# Clustering Techniques on the Iris Dataset
## Overview
### This repository contains an implementation of clustering techniques—KMeans and Hierarchical clustering—on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements of iris flowers and their respective species. The aim of this project is to explore how these clustering algorithms can identify patterns and groupings in the data without prior labels.

## Objective
### The objective of this assessment is to evaluate the application of clustering techniques to a real-world dataset and to gain insights into data structures.

## Dataset:
### Dataset: Iris dataset
### Source: Available in the sklearn library

## Features:
### Sepal length
### Sepal width
### Petal length
### Petal width
### Key Components

## Loading and Preprocessing:

### 1) Load the Iris dataset from sklearn.
### 2) Drop the species column to focus on clustering.
### 3) Clustering Algorithm Implementation:

## KMeans Clustering:
### Description and explanation of suitability for the Iris dataset.
### Code implementation and visualization of clusters.

## Hierarchical Clustering:
### Description and explanation of suitability for the Iris dataset.
###Code implementation and visualization of clusters.

## Conclusion:
### To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:
pandas
scikit-learn,
matplotlib,
seaborn,
scipy.
